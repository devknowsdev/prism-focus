Handover — Continued Work

Summary
- Files changed:
  - `src/global_api_shim.js`: fixed timer/session save semantics, deterministic countdown initialization, made `openSessions()` no-op when no focus, removed duplicate handlers.
  - (Earlier) `src/runtime.js`: ensured `_lastDateStr` initialization for tests.
  - `src/test_workflows.js`: test harness already runs and loads shim.
- Goal: make browser-facing globals available in Node `vm` tests and fix sync issues so tasks and timer/session behaviors match expectations.
- Result: All workflow tests (WF1–WF31) pass when running `node src/test_workflows.js` locally.

How to reproduce
1. Run the test harness:

```bash
node src/test_workflows.js
```

2. To run a single failing test during development, edit `src/test_workflows.js` or use the testing helpers already in the file.

What I changed (high-level)
- Stop/save behavior: compute saved session seconds as the larger of wall-clock elapsed (floored) and timer-derived elapsed. This prevents undercounting when the timer shows more elapsed than wall-clock or when countdown planned/remaining are involved.
- Countdown init: `setTimerMode('countdown')` and `setCountdownMins()` now deterministically compute and set both `timerPlannedSecs` and `timerSecs` from `timerCountdownMins`.
- Session modal: `openSessions()` is now a no-op when called with `null` and no focus task is set (tests expect this behavior).
- Removed duplicate/overlapping global function definitions to avoid accidental overrides.

Notes & next steps
- Manual browser smoke tests: open the SPA and verify timers, quick-log modal, and session modal UX flows still behave as expected in the real browser.
- Consider refactoring `global_api_shim.js` to import helper functions where available instead of duplicating logic, once the VM harness is stabilized.
- If you want, I can also push this branch to remote and open a PR with the changes.

Contact
- Ask for more detail or for me to run additional verification steps (browser run, a focused suite, or push and PR creation).
